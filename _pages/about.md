I am a third year math PhD student at UCLA advised by [Guido Montúfar](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/). My recent work has been on understanding loss landscapes in deep learning, and designing architectures for graph neural networks which incorporate long-range interactions. More broadly, I'm interested in graph neural networks/geometric deep learning, optimization theory, and machine learning problems with a combinatorial flavor. Before coming to UCLA, I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics at Penn State. My résumé is available [here](Resume.pdf).
