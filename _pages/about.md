I am a third year math PhD student at UCLA advised by [Guido Montúfar](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/). I'm interested in deep learning theory, and particularly in determining when and why neural networks optimize and generalize well. My recent work has been on characterizing benign overfitting under relaxed data assumptions, and understanding the loss landscape and initialization of neural networks. I am also interested in graph neural networks (GNNs). Some of my past work focused on alleviating the issues of oversquashing and oversmoothing in GNNs using spectral properties of the underlying graph.  Before coming to UCLA, I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics at Penn State. My résumé is available [here](Resume.pdf).
