I am a second year math PhD student at UCLA advised by [Guido Montúfar](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/). I am interested in deep learning theory and graph neural networks. My recent work has been on alleviating the problems of oversquashing and oversmoothing in graph neural networks. Before coming to UCLA, I was an undergraduate at Penn State, where I also studied math. My résumé is available [here](Resume.pdf).
