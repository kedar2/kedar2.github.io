I am a quantitative researcher at [G-Research](https://www.gresearch.com/). Before this, I earned my PhD in mathematics from UCLA, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Guido Montúfar](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/). My PhD research was on the mathematical theory of neural networks, and in particular understanding optimization and generalization under moderate-dimensional scaling of parameterization, dataset dimensionality, and sample size.
