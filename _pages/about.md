I am a fourth year math PhD student at UCLA working with [Guido Montúfar](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/). I'm interested in deep learning theory. Optimization and generalization in neural networks are sometimes nicer than one might expect. I've worked towards understanding this by characterizing how optimization and generalization are influenced by the relative scaling of parameter count, dataset size, and dataset dimensionality.
