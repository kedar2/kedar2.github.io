I am a second year math PhD student at UCLA advised by [Guido Montúfar](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/). My recent work has been on understanding optimization landscapes in deep learning, and designing architectures for graph neural networks which incorporate long-range interactions. Some of my research interests are

- Graph neural networks and graph transformers
- Optimization theory and training dynamics in deep learning
- Algebraic and combinatorial approaches to machine learning

Before coming to UCLA, I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics at Penn State. My résumé is available [here](Resume.pdf).
